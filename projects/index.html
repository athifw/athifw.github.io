	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>Here is a list of projects I have worked on, either by myself or with other people. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments!</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://playpaparazzi.com/">Paparazzi</a>: A social game developed using Ruby on Rails with other interns at Viget. In Paparazzi, a player can win by taking pictures of other participants without getting caught themselves.
		<li><p><a href="https://athif-haxxor.herokuapp.com">Haxxor Clone</a>: A clone of the popular news website <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> made using Ruby on Rails. This application was also developed while I was interning at Viget.
		<li><p><a href="http://devpost.com/software/watchme">WatchMe</a>: An application made for the Pebble Watch for user safety. A user can open the application and call an emergency contact with an autonomous message containing the user's location.
	</ul>
