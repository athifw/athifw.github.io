My internship at Viget turned out to be an amazing and eye-opening experience for me. After learning how to code with Ruby on Rails while writing the Haxxor clone \(more on that in my older posts\), I worked with the other interns at Viget to work on a group project. Throughout the 10-week internship, we brainstormed different ideas to work on and then implemented these ideas. Our end result was [Paparazzi](https://playpaparazzi.com/), a social game designed for a group of people to get to know each other. I learned a lot from developing Paparazzi - not only from coding the application itself, but also from collaborating with all of the other interns. Every week we would have 3 meetings to discuss progress and upcoming features, and I've experienced how to develop in an agile environment. 

After the internship, I started my final year here at Northwestern. Out of the classes I've taken this quarter, the most interesting class was [EECS 301](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~argall/eecs301/): Introductory Robotics Laboratory. We built and programmed a robot over the course of the class; it progressed from walking to mapping a maze using machine learning algorithms. I'm working on completing concentrations in artificial intelligence and interfaces, and I hope to dive in to artifical intelligence next quarter as well.

In my final two quarters I'm planning to take some project classes within Northwestern's EECS department, as well as a software development course. I'll post updates on here about those, as well as any other projects I work on in my spare time or in hackathons. Thanks for reading!
