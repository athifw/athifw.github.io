Here's a quick update of my internship here at Viget. After my last blog post, I updated the site to include [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments for each individual post. I also set the home page to show the first few words of a blog post so that the user can choose to "continue reading" a specific blog post. If you have any suggestions or questions, please let me know!

In the coming days, I will be building my own version of the [Hacker News site](https://news.ycombinator.com/) from scratch using Ruby on Rails. The link to that project will be posted here as well.
