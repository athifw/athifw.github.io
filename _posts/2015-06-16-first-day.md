title: First Day at Viget

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post on this site, which was created using Jekyll and hosted by Github Pages. I have just started my Ruby Development Internship at [Viget](http://viget.com) in Durham, North Carolina, and so far, I like it a lot here. One reason why is that when I first got here, I plunged head-first into multiple projects. I learned so much on my first day here, which I can't say for my computer science classes at Northwestern. The best way to learn for me is to keep creating projects, including this site and hopefully more to come in the future.

Another reason why I love it here is the Viget family. Viget's Durham location has just over 15 members, and all of them have really welcomed me. Their philosophy emphasizes teamwork and sharing, and I have already seen a lot of that in just my first hours here. I attended multiple meetings yesterday, and my questions and comments were well received even though it was my first day as an intern. I look forward to the rest of my internship here at Viget, and I can't wait to work on some exciting projects \(which I will provide updates on here\)! Thanks for reading!
