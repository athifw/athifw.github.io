title: Starting Haxxor News

Today I started my 'Haxxor' site, which is going to be a Hacker News clone. So far, I've managed to create a working Ruby application with an 'Article' model. This model contains information on the author, title of the page, and url. I have also implemented test-driven development, which means that I usually write the tests for some portion of code and then write the actual code to pass the tests. As I said before, these tests are extremely useful, especially when changing code that does not seem to affect these tests. Running the tests can show whether these changes affect the end result.

I also learned more about git, specifically about git branches. I've never used git branches when working before - I usually committed and pushed all the changes I made to the project. Git branches are used when adding new features - for example, once I started the 'Article' model, I initialized another branch for all of the model-related code to go in. Once I finish that, I will merge the branch with the 'master' branch. Git branches are very useful, and I'm definitely going to use them more often.
