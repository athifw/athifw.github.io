title: Days 3 and 4 - Tests in Ruby
layout: post
---

On Wednesday I started a simple Ruby on Rails application to implement a blog site with the help of Chris Jones, a dev here in Viget's Durham location. The goal of this was to refresh the basics of a Rails application, including using git and a database. We also went over using the 'rspec' and 'capybara' gems to do tests. Rspec is a very flexible tool, and I was able to test my application in many different ways using capybara. It can 'expect' to see a String on a webpage and even fill out forms and click links. These gems can be programmed to essentially run tests like a user would. Before, I never really saw why tests were necessary (especially when the code for these tests is longer than the actual solution for these tests) but now I can see not only how useful they are, but how easy they are to implement, especially with rspec.

Today I'll be continuing this application and hopefully starting the hacker news site I mentioned yesterday. I will also be starting a group project with the other interns at Viget soon, and I'm sure we'll come up with something awesome!
