title: User Authentication for Articles
layout: post

When I first started the Haxxor application, I generated the article model first. This meant that any visitor could upload a link for an article. So after adding the user model, I had to tie the user logins with article creation. I did this with sessions, which create cookies in the browser. I also edited the articles controller to only create an article if a user was logged in. After doing this, I deleted the 'user' field in the article form so that only the user's name would be attributed to the created article.

Next week, I'm going to implement threaded commenting to articles - users will be able to reply to both articles and comments.
